		- As a software project grows, version control becomes essential for to track your project versions code 
		- version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.
		- With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository)
		- Developers can make changes a particular part of code safely without affecting the rest of the project code.
		- Once developers completed changes a particular part of code then it can merge that code back into the main source code
		- All this changes will track and reverted whenever neccessary.
	
	2 Git 
		- It is a specific open-source version control system.
		- Git is a distributed version control system
		- That means entire code and its history is available to everyone.
		- To achieve this things git provide some basic commands to create,store & manage your codebase.
 - So GitHub is combination of both version Control & git to make GitHub, that interface is available for end user cloud based hosting service.
