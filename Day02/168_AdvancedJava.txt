MySQL 

1 Create Table 
	create table employee(id int ,name varChar(150),address varchar(150)); 
2 Data save 
	insert into employee(name,address) value("name","address");
3 select data
	select * from employee
4 update data 
	update employee set name="..." , address="..." where  id=9;
5 delete data 
		delete from employee where id=9;
6 particular record to get from db 
	select * from employee where id=2
	
	1  create database 168 
	
	Create Table 
		create table employee(empid int primary Key auto_increment,ename varChar(20),job varChar(20));
	insert data into table 
		insert into employee values(1,"Sumit",'DevOps');
		insert into employee(ename,job) values("Sumit",'DevOps');
	Update data into table 
		update employee set ename="sumit123" job="..." where empid=1;
	delete data into table 
		delete from employee where empid=1
	Fetch the data from table 
		select * from employee;
		select empid,ename from employee;

1 JDBC Drivers
	
	- A software that enables java application to interact with database. It is simple carrier to connect your java application to data base. Where driver is act like bridge between any application to db that store the data into database.Here 4 different Types of driver 

	1 Type I --- Jdbc Odbc Bridge Driver
			JDBC -> java database connectivity (Design by sunmicrosystem)
			odbc -> Open database connectivity (Design by windows microsoft)
			- Here ODBC is only windows specific os it is not used for any other OS, so it is removed support in java 7, in the previous version it has support 
			
	2 Type II --- JDBC - Native API 		
		
			- Here we avoid ODBC instead of we use vendor specific driver 
			- In this type finally removed OS dependancy.
			- But this vendor specific driver has to be installed on all system 
			Partially in C & Java --- Vendor specific
		- e.g. Oracle OCI driver -- but now outdated.
		
	3 Type III --- JDBC network protocol driver
		- In this type initially we installed our API on server and that server will transform your api to client machine
		- When someone is connected to this server through the internet a small copy of API is sending to respective client machine.
		- Basically it is indirectly installed that API in your machine through network so it is called network protocol driver.
		- Here Type 2 API driver is running on server and whenever you give the request to server it transform that API in your machine and installed it.
	
		Middleware driver
		- e.g. WebLogic RMI driver
		
	4 Type IV --- Jdbc thin/Universal driver
		- It is not used any middleware driver to connect the DB
		- It is Two step process 
		  1st step is Java code -> type 4 and 
		  2nd step is type 4 to database & vice versa
	
		Fully in Java -- Portable -- Vendor specific
		- e.g. MySQL Connector (mysql-connector-x.y.z.jar) , Oracle thin driver (ojdbcx.jar), Driver url is 
			Mysql => com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
			Oracle => oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
	 
	
What is Database Driver?
2 Mysql Driver Configuration


MySQL Driver Connection -:
String DB_DRIVER = "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver";
String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/emp161db";
String DB_USER = "root";
String DB_PASSWORD = "Sumit@123";

Oracle Driver Connection -:
String DB_DRIVER = "oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver";
String DB_URL = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE";
String DB_USER = "hr";
String DB_PASSWORD = "hr";

3 JDBC Steps:
	1. Load & register driver class.
			Class.ForName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");			
			static{
			.....
			}
			
			{
				
			}
			
		2. Get JDBC connection (using DriverManager).
			jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/emplyee, root ,root 
		3. Create JDBC statement (SQL query).
		4. Execute the query and collect result.
			- SELECT ---> executeQuery() -- ResultSet (rows & cols)
			OR
			- Non-SELECT --> executeUpdate() -- int (affected rows).
		5. Close all.
		
	
4 JDBC objects:
		1. Driver ---> Create socket connection with database & authenticate. Should be registered with DriverManager.Managing a set of JDBC Driver(oracle/mysql/nosql etc.) 
		2. Connection ---> Encapsulate socket connection & used for creating statements and managing transactions.
		3. Statement ---> Reresents SQL query. Can be DDL, DML or DQL.
			-- PreparedStatement -- For executing parameterized queries.
				e.g. INSERT INTO DEPT VALUES(?,?,?);			
		4. ResultSet ---> Like a cursor in RDBMS. Used to access records/rows one by one.
